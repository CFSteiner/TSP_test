# TSP_test
Travelliing salesman problem solver re-written from FORTRAN to C++, using simulated annealing. 

Input data would be in form of 
N 
X1 Y1
X2 Y2
...
XN YN

where N is the number of points. Example
5
0 0
0 0.5
0 1
1 1
1 0

The code is not quite as fast as it is in FORTRAN. If written in C++ from the start, it could be handled much differently. 
The C++ version only exists for performance comparison.
